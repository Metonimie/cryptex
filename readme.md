# Cryptex

**This extension is partially finished!**

This is my first extension, It's purpose is to encrypt text with AES cipher from [CryptoJS](https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS) using a locally stored passphrase.

# How to use

Enter the text you want to encrypt/decrypt in the text box and click the button.
If you want to use a specific key, update the key field.

If you want to reuse the key every time, hit the store button, the next time
you start the extension the key field will be empty but the encryption and
decryption process will use the stored key.
