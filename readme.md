# Cryptex
**This extension is not finished!**

This is my first extension, It's purpose is to encrypt text with AES cipher from [CryptoJS](https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS) using a locally stored passphrase.

Unfortunately I can't get WebStorage to work, and you have to enter the passphrase every time.
I've tried some example extensions and it didn't work there either.
